# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise wants to start a Crowndfunding Campaign to start her play, Fever. She's estimating a budget over $10,000,and understandably hesitate about jumping into her first fundraising campaign. Her Play came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time.

### Purpose
Using Excel to organize, sort and analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a Project's campaign successful.
We will figure out how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
There are two charts listed below to show how outcomes connected between the lunch date and goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We will see based on the lunching month,most projects lunched on the second quarter of the year. There's a peak for outcomes successful in May. And for failed outcomes, it appears most from May to August, also another peak for failed outcomes shows in October. For cancled outcomes, it stays stable, the number is always below 10. In December, the numbers for Successful and Failed Outcome are nearly the same.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
From the chart below, we will see the percentage of Successful, Failed and Cancled outcomes based on Goals.
For the successful outcomes, it happens most with goals set below $1000 and between $1000 -$4999. When goals set at $45000 to $49999, there's no successful outcome.
For the failed outcomes, the peak is at the goal $45000 t0 $49999, it reached 100%. The outcomes failed least when the goal is set below $5000.
There is no cancled outcomes.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Since we figured out how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.As we see when the Goal is over $10,000, the successful percentage is below 60%. 
The things we need top focus on is when to lunch the canpaign and how long it will last. How we can use the data to make sure Louise will get her goal funds.

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1.The projects lunched most in the second quartare of the year, and lunched least for the fourth quartare.
2.The Peak for successful and Failed projects both appears in May, however the peak for Cancled projects appears in January.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
For the successful outcomes, it happens most with goals set below $1000 and between $1000 -$4999. When goals set at $45000 to $49999, there's no successful outcome.
For the failed outcomes, the peak is at the goal $45000 t0 $49999, it reached 100%. The outcomes failed least when the goal is set below $5000.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
There is a time limit in the dataset, it only shows data from 2009 to 2017, but in the near 5 years, there could be a huge trend change in different categories.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- First We could have a table shows the connection between the country and the outcome successful/ failed or cancled percentage.
- Then we can have a graphs shows the trend through years in different parent catagories.
