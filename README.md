# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise wants to start a Crowndfunding Campaign to start her play, Fever. She's estimating a budget over $10,000,and understandably hesitate about jumping into her first fundraising campaign. Her Play came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time.

### Purpose
Using Excel to organize, sort and analyze crowdfunding data to determine whether there are specific factors that make a Project's campaign successful.
We will figure out how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
There are two charts listed below to show how outcomes connected between the lunch date and goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We will see based on the lunching month,most projects lunched on the second quarter of the year. There's a peak for outcomes successful in May. And for failed outcomes, it appears most from May to August, also another peak for failed outcomes shows in October. For cancled outcomes, it stays stable, the number is always below 10. In December, the numbers for Successful and Failed Outcome are nearly the same.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
